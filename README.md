### Project Description

This is a fun and interactive Malayalam web app that helps users express their current mood and challenges them with a playful ‚Äúopposite task‚Äù to lighten their day. Users select their mood from a dropdown menu, and the app suggests a humorous and quirky activity opposite to their mood. For example, if someone feels lazy, the app might suggest doing some energetic dance moves!

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)

[People sometimes get stuck in one mood or mindset and need a fun, simple nudge to break out of it]

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)

[Our project provides a fun, interactive web app that:

Lets users select their current mood from a dropdown.

Gives them a random funny task that is the opposite of their mood.

These tasks are playful, unexpected activities that encourage users to break their usual mood pattern.

This playful nudge can help users laugh, feel lighter, or try something new, which can improve their emotional state.!]
